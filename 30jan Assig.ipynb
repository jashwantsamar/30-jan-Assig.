    "    In this code, we first ask the user to enter a number. We then initialize a variable called count to 0, which will keep track of the number of times the given number can be divided by 3.\n",

    "We use a while loop to divide the number by 3 repeatedly until it becomes less than or equal to 10. Inside the loop, we divide the number by 3 and increment the count by 1.\n",

    "In this example, we initialize the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence to 0 and 1. We then use a while loop to generate the sequence and calculate the next number in the sequence using the formula c = a + b. We update the values of a and b to the previous two numbers in the sequence, and continue the loop until we find a number greater than 1000. Finally, we print the first number greater than 1000, which is stored in the variable b.\n",

    "In summary, a while loop is used in Python when you need to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It is typically used when you do not know the exact number of iterations needed to complete a task, and the loop must continue until a certain condition is met.\n",
